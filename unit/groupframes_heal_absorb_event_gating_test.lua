-- Regression: "Show Absorb Shield" and "Show Heal Absorb" are independent
-- toggles, but UpdateSelectiveEvents gated UNIT_HEAL_ABSORB_AMOUNT_CHANGED on
-- the absorb flag. Turning Show Absorb Shield off while Show Heal Absorb stayed
-- on unregistered the only event that drives UpdateHealAbsorb, freezing the
-- heal-absorb bar. The heal-absorb event must be gated on its own setting.
