-- Root cause under test: cdm_containers' scheduleActiveState held ONE pending
-- callback in a single upvalue while BOTH hook instances (buff/essential/utility
-- + trackedBar) schedule through it. Overlapping active-state flips (a buff-icon
-- and a tracked-bar aura changing within the 2-tick settle window -- routine at
-- pull start) made the second schedule overwrite the first: the losing instance's
-- flush never ran and its _activeScheduled latch stuck true for the whole
-- session, leaving that surface permanently deaf to OnActiveStateChanged.
