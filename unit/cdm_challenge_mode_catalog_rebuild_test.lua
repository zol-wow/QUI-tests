-- tests/unit/cdm_challenge_mode_catalog_rebuild_test.lua
-- Regression: entering a Mythic+ key (or an encounter / rated PvP match) must
-- rebuild the CDM catalog through a LIVE path.
--
-- cdm_resolvers.lua's RebuildCatalog() is wired to fire on CHALLENGE_MODE_START
-- (and ENCOUNTER_START / PVP_MATCH_ACTIVE). Its header explains *why*: aura
-- instance IDs re-randomize on those boundaries, so the catalog must rebuild.
-- But RebuildCatalog() only bumps CDMResolvers._catalogVersion and publishes
-- "CDM:CATALOG_REBUILT". If nothing consumes that signal, the rebuild is a
-- no-op: cooldown/aura bindings stay bound to the pre-key state and durations
-- do not show until the player /reloads or swaps spec.
--
-- This test asserts the wiring contract that is currently violated: the
-- lifecycle event published on key entry has at least one consumer. Source-
-- structure assertions mirror the established pattern in
-- tests/unit/cdm_combat_reload_test.lua (the cdm_resolvers chunk is ~3.2k lines
-- of coupled resolver logic, impractical to execute headlessly).
--
-- Run from repo root: lua tests/unit/cdm_challenge_mode_catalog_rebuild_test.lua
