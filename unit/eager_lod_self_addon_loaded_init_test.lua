-- Run: lua tests/unit/eager_lod_self_addon_loaded_init_test.lua
--
-- Regression guard for the "Eager-LOD self-ADDON_LOADED init is DEAD" class.
--
-- These modules live in eager-loaded LOD sub-addons (QUI_QoL, QUI_Minimap),
-- which the core eager-LoadAddOn's from OnEnable. A module's own ADDON_LOADED
-- self-event is NOT delivered to a handler it registers during that load, so any
-- init gated on `arg == ADDON_NAME` never runs (in-game report: combat timer /
-- brez counter / crosshair / reticle etc. "enabled but never appear in an
-- encounter"; the minimap would simply never skin/anchor). Init must instead run
-- via ns.WhenLoggedIn (fires immediately for a post-login LOD load).
--
-- This guards the files that were converted away from the dead pattern. Each
-- MUST install its init via ns.WhenLoggedIn and MUST NOT gate init on its own
-- ADDON_LOADED ("~= ADDON_NAME"). QUI_Minimap keeps a positive `== ADDON_NAME`
-- branch as a clean-stack fallback (live toggle / tests), which is allowed — the
-- guard only forbids the dead `~= ADDON_NAME` gating. The behavioral counterpart
-- for the combat timer is combattimer_login_init_test.lua.
