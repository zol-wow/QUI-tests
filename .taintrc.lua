    --    Only FailureMode = "Error" predicates (RequiresUnitAuraAccess)

    --  - conditionalSecretContents (round-22): the extractor now captures

    --    Element-level hazard modeling ("secret contents of a safe
    --    container": flag unprobed element/field use of such returns) is
    --    WIRED as of round-23: marker-based element taint on flagged
    --    returns, driven by two config keys — element_secret_functions
    --    (call-site spellings of wrapper functions whose result 1 carries
    --    the hazard; C_UnitAuras.GetUnitAuras itself stays index-wired,
    --    not listed here) and element_container_params (helper name ->
    --    declared-param positions, for helpers that receive an
    --    already-tainted container as an argument rather than a call
    --    result). Adding a wrapper requires the spelling audit: grep every
    --    call-site spelling of the wrapper across the repo and list each
    --    distinct one; value-copy aliases (`local Get =
    --    C_UnitAuras.GetUnitAuras`, incl. `A and A.f` chains) resolve
    --    automatically and must NOT be listed, but receiver-import
    --    spellings (`Sources.QueryUnitAuras` where `Sources` is a local
    --    table alias, not a function-value copy) do NOT resolve and MUST
    --    be listed individually — a missed spelling is a silent false
    --    negative the strict scan cannot surface on its own. Runtime
    --    choke-point probes remain defense-in-depth (round-16 canon).
    --  - Round-13b collapse-rule NON-GOALS (known and accepted): bare
    --    `Show()`/`Hide()` calls inside guard-secret branches are
    --    unflagged (call-shaped defer is indistinguishable from
    --    call-shaped state manufacture); literals laundered through a
    --    local (`local v = true ... return v`) evade the scan;
    --    stored-boolean guards (`local b = G(x)`) are invisible;
    --    terminating untaint-then fall-through (`if not G(x) then ...
    --    return end; return 0` — the fall-through IS the secret region)
    --    is unflagged; plain undocumented FUNCTION consumers remain
    --    traversal-only (non-interprocedural boundary — hand-audit
    --    helpers).
    --  - Two instrumentation-discovered analyzer-gap classes (2026-07-18,
    --    both were strict-green live crashes until Task 7's boundary
    --    tests caught them): (a) helper-PARAM probe-order blindness —
    --    `param == nil` before probe inside a helper function body

    --    in-expression probe (reticle.lua:439 class).
